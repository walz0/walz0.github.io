                            Welcome to my website! Below is a showcase of some
                            of the noteworthy programming and design projects 
                            that I have worked on over the past couple of years.
                            Here you can find my resume as well as some background
                            on who I am, what I am currently working on, and what 
                            I plan to do in the future. If you would like to see
                            in more detail what I am currently working on, there
                            is a link to my GitHub page in the Calendar to the right.

                            I'm currently a Computer Science major at Indiana University Bloomington.
                            I have been programming in various capacities for almost five years now,
                            mostly in object-oriented languages like C# and Java. I have a passion
                            for problem-solving and design that I express by making all of my own
                            assets. All of the graphics within my apps are self-made; I enjoy the
                            process of bringing all of the pieces together to make a cohesive user
                            experience. Going forward, I would like to focus my efforts more toward
                            software engineering than web design and development. If you would like to 
                            see what I have been working on recently, as well as my past projects, you
                            can take a look at my GitHub. My resume contains a more detailed summary
                             of what I have done aside from code. Click this button to check it out!

                            This is an app that can be used to monitor 
                            stock prices and calculate
                            useful metrics such as a company's return on invested
                            capital (ROIC), and earnings yield. These metrics
                            can be calculated in bulk (by specified industry),
                            and then ranked accordingly. The core functionality
                            is a web scraper that travels to financial websites
                            and pulls the necessary numbers to do the calculations.
                            This project was created in order to practice
                             asynchronous programming. In

                            This app is useful for visualizing mathematical
                            functions in greater detail than what could be
                            done on a normal graphing utility. Features include:
                            animated functions, vectors, real-time tangent line
                            to curve, and derivative functions. This project
                            was created as a means of learning javascript and
                            introducing myself to app development in the browser.
                            However, what originally was a web app transformed 
                            into a desktop app which utilized the electron framework.
